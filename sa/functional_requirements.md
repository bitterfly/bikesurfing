# Functional requirements

After consulting with owner's requirements, reviewing the current state of the web service and envisioning our ideas we have come up with the following functional requirements. We have devised a system that divides requirements based on type of user and relative priority.

### Types of users

Every requirement has its own unique identification code, e.g. `FR305`. The letters are an abbreviation for `Functional Requirement`. They are followed by a 3 digit code identifier. The first digit in the number represents the type of user the requirement is for. The following digits make up the requirement's number which increases by a factor of 5 so it's easier to make additions to the list without having to reorder it or put something out of place.

##### These are the types of users and their respective digits in the functional requirements:

1. Guest
2. User
3. Bike holder
4. City admin
5. Sysadmin

### Requirement priority

We will be using the [MoSCoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) method as a prioritizing technique for the functional requirements.

> The term MoSCoW itself is an acronym derived from the first letter of each of four prioritization categories (_Must have, Should have, Could have,_ and _Would like but won't get_), with the interstitial os added simply to make the word pronounceable. ~Wikipedia
